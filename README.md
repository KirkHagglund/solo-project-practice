# Daily Task Reminder

## User Story

As a busy developer working on a team project and two freelance projects,
I want to organize my day to maximize efficiency and coordinate meetings with my team.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given the need to meet once daily for said meetings,
I will need to both record the scheduled times and have reminders prompt me one hour beforehand.

Once I schedule a task or meeting into a time slot,
I want the time slot to change color from grey to yellow, signifying a full time slot with an assigned task.

Once I complete a task, 
I want the color of the panel to change to green, meaning a completed task.

If I am unable to complete a task during its given time slot,
I wasnt the color panel to change to red, and send me two daily alerts reminding me of a previous task still needing completion.
